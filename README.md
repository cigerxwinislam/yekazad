Bismillahirrahmanirrahim 
Elhamdülillahirabbülalemin 
Es-selatu vesselamu alâ Rasulîna Muhammedin ve alâ alihi ve sahbihi ecmain.


Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd yuhyi wa yumeet wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful  
All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds  
Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.

There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is over all things competent.
